    "Imagine that the four lines the first image represent four point-light sources, with the heigt of each representing its intensity.  The diffraction limit of light, and the lens through which an observation is made, blurr the light signal that is emmitted from the four sources, so the combined signal might look like the middle image.  Capturing and storing an image of the light involves discretization.  If the four light sources are located very close to each other, it may occur that all four sources fall within a 6 by 6 pixel square, resulting the the given image.\n",

    "So far, the fact that the number of sources $\\hat{k}$ is unknown has not been addressed.  A simple approach, insprired by the ADCG method, is to first insert the source which would result in the greatest decrease in the objective.  Then, the PSF-signal of that source is subtracted from the original image (thresholding negative values), to obtain a residual-image.  The subsequent source insertion is done by finding the maximal decrease over the residual-image.  After each insertion, the sources are collectively adjusted until a new minima is found, after which is residaul-image is updated.  This is repeated until the objective reaches a termination tolerance.\n",
