# SuperResolution

Sparse super resolution entainls post-processing images of few sufficiently separated ligt sources to resolve their positions to a higher accuracy than that of the imaging device.

A number of different solution approaches to this probelm have been proposed.  This is a toy example of a nonlinear least squares (NLS) approach to the sparse superresolution probelm.  

A rudimentary implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm is used to solve the NLS probelm.
