# SuperResolution

Sparse superresolution entails post-processing images of few sufficiently separated light sources to resolve their positions to a higher accuracy than that of the imaging device.

This is a toy example of a *nonlinear least squares* (NLS) approach to the sparse super-resolution problem.  

A rudimentary implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm is used to solve both the source injection and localisation subproblems.

See the notebook for a more detailed explanation, and src.py for algorithm implementations.
