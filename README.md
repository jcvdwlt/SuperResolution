# SuperResolution

Sparse super-resolution entails post-processing images of few sufficiently separated light sources to resolve their positions to a higher accuracy than that of the imaging device.

A number of different solution approaches to this problem have been proposed. This is a toy example of a *nonlinear least squares* (NLS) approach to the sparse superresolution problem.

A rudimentary implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm is used to solve the NLS problem.
